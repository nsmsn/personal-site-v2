      <h1>Accessibility Statement</h1>

<p>The web is meant for everyone, and I am committed to designing useful, usable, and inclusive experiences.</p>
<p>I want as many people as possible to be able to use my website. For example, that means you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>change colors, contrast levels and text sizes using your device settings.</li>
<li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen.</li>
<li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard.</li>
<li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="standards-and-testing">Standards and Testing <a class="direct-link" href="#standards-and-testing">#</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a> defines requirements for designers and developers to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities (and user friendly for everyone). My site aims to conform to <strong>WCAG 2.2 level AA</strong>.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/">standards-compliant HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</a> throughout this website. Anyone using a web browser that honors these standards should be capable of navigating this site.</p>
<p>In addition to being tested on the latest versions of Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari, this site has been manually checked for ease of use with a keyboard and the VoiceOver screen reader. I also periodically audit the site using <a href="https://wave.webaim.org">WAVE</a> and <a href="https://tenon.io/">Tenon</a>, browser-based testing services.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features <a class="direct-link" href="#features">#</a></h2>
<p>Pages are structured with semantic elements like <code>header</code>, <code>nav</code>, <code>main</code>, and <code>footer</code>, which may help you move around more quickly. The main content area of each page is marked with a <code>h1</code> (heading level 1), and each page’s structure should follow a logical heading order from there.</p>
<p>Each page on this website has a “skip to content” link at the top, and a “back to top” link at the very bottom.</p>
<p>Images are described with <a href="https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/alt-text/">text alternatives</a>, using the <code>alt</code> attribute. This website’s colors were chosen to ensure there is sufficient color contrast between elements on each page. My site has been coded to honor user device preferences whenever possible.</p>
<p>I strive to use <a href="https://www.plainlanguage.gov/about/definitions/">plain language</a> throughout this site and use a <a href="https://readabilityformulas.com/free-readability-formula-tests.php">readability checker</a> to test my content and improve my writing.</p>
<h2 id="known-issues">Known Issues <a class="direct-link" href="#known-issues">#</a></h2>
<p>Any known issues will be listed or described here, as they are reported or as I discover them.</p>
<p>I can’t guarantee that all content linked to or embedded on this site is fully accessible, though I will do my best to link to accessible and inclusive sites whenever possible.</p>
<h2 id="share-feedback">Share Feedback <a class="direct-link" href="#share-feedback">#</a></h2>
<p>I am personally committed to educating myself on digital accessibility, sharing what I learn, and putting it into practice. That said, if you encounter any difficulty using my site, please let me know! You may <a href="https://github.com/nsmsn/nicksimsondotcom/issues">file an issue on GitHub</a> or <a href="mailto:nick@nicksimson.com">email me directly</a>. I take these issues very seriously and welcome your feedback and suggestions.</p>
