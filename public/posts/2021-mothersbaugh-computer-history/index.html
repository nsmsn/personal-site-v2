<p>Once you stumble upon it on YouTube, the Computer History Museum's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQsxaNhYv8daKdGi7s85ubzbWdTB36-_q">Oral History series</a> is a wonderful trove of technologists, pioneers, and inventors sharing their histories in their own words. Composer and DEVO frontman Mark Mothersbaugh <a href="https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2018/02/102738588-05-01-acc.pdf">sat down with CHM</a> a few years ago to talk about his synthesizers, his process, and his beginnings in Akron, Ohio.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfeLBV3J6NI">video below</a> was recorded in 2017:</p>

<p>Mothersbaugh‚Äôs <a href="http://mutato.com/">studio in Los Angeles</a> is famous for its collection of synths, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_bending">circuit-bended</a> instruments, and sound technology going back decades, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronium">Raymond Scott‚Äôs Electronium</a>. A highlight of this interview is hearing him compare his relationship to the Mini Moog to that of a soldier and his rifle.</p>
<p>My favorite part of this video is toward the end (around the <a href="https://youtu.be/YfeLBV3J6NI?t=4098">01:08:18</a> mark), when Mothersbaugh pulls out a postage stamp collector‚Äôs binder filled with drawings on paper:</p>
<blockquote>
Everyday, I draw on paper... I draw on paper everyday, since 19...early 70s. I was into mail art, is how it started. And I found that a nobody from Akron, Ohio, that nobody‚Äôd ever heard of, called Mark Mothersbaugh, could take a piece of paper and send it to Robert Indiana, or send it to Jasper Johns,or Irene Dogmatic, or Mr. Peanut, and there was a good chance they would send something back to me. And it was like, to get something in the mail from Robert Indiana was such a... it was amazing. I felt like I was on the map...So I was doing these drawings all the time and sending them out, and then I was also putting together a band. And in the process of that, I was sending something out to somebody, and I said, ‚ÄúHey, these... this could be&ndash;if we ever get to do a record, this could be the cover for it.‚Äù And I started to put it in the mail, and then I said, ‚ÄúWait a second. Maybe I should be saving this stuff.‚Äù
</blockquote>
<p>I especially love the consistency of these sketchbooks: choosing the same size paper to draw on each day and cataloguing them all in hundreds of stamp binders. You can see some of <a href="https://markmothersbaughart.com/art/">Mothersbaugh‚Äôs visual art on his website</a>.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/devos-mark-mothersbaugh-opens-up-about-covid-19-hospitalization-and-recovery/">nearly lost Mark Mothersbaugh last year to COVID-19</a>. Thankfully he‚Äôll still be producing art and music for years to come, adding to his impressive archive.</p>

<p><strong>Bonus video:</strong> A friend with two young kids reminded me that Mark Mothersbaugh was a regular on the children‚Äôs TV show <i>Yo Gabba Gabba</i>, contributing segments where he would make a drawing and interact with the animated sketch:</p>
