<small class="timestamp">Published <time datetime="2016-06-11T00:00:00.000Z" class="dt-published"><a class="u-url" href=".">June 11, 2016</a></time> by <a rel="author" class="p-author h-card" href="/info/">Nick</a></small>

<div class="e-content flow">
<p>I recently stumbled across a website called <a href="http://webfieldmanual.com/">Web Field Manual</a>, a directory of resources &quot;focused on documenting only the best knowledge for designing experiences and interfaces on the web.&quot;</p>
<p>The directory features a ton of links to information sources on relevant front-end web design topics: design process, style guide documentation, grids and typography, accessibility, and specific web technologies. Many of the articles and projects linked here I was familiar with, but several are new to me as well.</p>
<p>No single link or author is the authoritative end-point for a particular subject. Combined, all these approaches make up a useful body of knowledge. Here are a few recent things I've discovered that are currently influencing or changing my web design approach:</p>
<h2 id="itcss"><a href="http://itcss.io">ITCSS</a> <a class="direct-link" href="#itcss">#</a></h2>
<p>Short for <em>Inverted Triangle Cascading Stylesheets</em>, an approach to CSS architecture coined by Harry Roberts that is more strategy than strict methodology. ITCSS is primarily concerned with avoiding a needless complexity throughout the cascade by keeping the broadest, most reusable rules at the beginning of the file and finishes with the most specific rules (style overrides) at the end.</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/@jordankoschei/how-i-shrank-my-css-by-84kb-by-refactoring-with-itcss-2e8dafee123a#.es1uf4lio">Jordan Koschei wrote an informative article</a> detailing how he refactored his own website styles using ITCSS, and how this shrank the file size of his final stylesheet and boosted his web performance. The <a href="https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture/">Xfive blog also recently published a helpful overview</a>. The ITCSS strategy can be easily combined with other CSS architecture approaches, such as SMACSS, OOCSS, or BEM. I'm currently applying the ITCSS approach on a side project, and have already found it both useful and efficient for naming and organizing my CSS files.</p>
<h2 id="fluid%2C-mathematical-web-typography"><a href="https://jxnblk.com/blog/mathematical-web-typography/">Fluid, Mathematical Web Typography</a> <a class="direct-link" href="#fluid%2C-mathematical-web-typography">#</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://jxnblk.com/blog/mathematical-web-typography/">This post by Brent Jackson</a> builds upon previous writing on <a href="http://typecast.com/blog/a-more-modern-scale-for-web-typography">modular scale typesetting</a> by others, proposing a simple set of rules to make type on the web infinitely scaleable and fluid, instead of relying on context-driven &quot;magic numbers&quot;. A potentially infinite canvas throws a wrench into the historic conventions of typesetting, where rules have been built on fixed dimensions for centuries.</p>
<p>Michael Riethmuller wrote more recently on <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/05/fluid-typography/">fluid typography with viewport units</a>. In this instance, &quot;fluid&quot; web type also means that there is no maximum <code>font-size</code> property, but the font system is sized in relationship to the overall canvas size. Responsive web design (largely) solved the designer dilemma for the mass adoption of smaller screens, but the <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=viewport-units">increasing support</a> of viewport units and a typescale that increases exponentially could better <a href="https://css-tricks.com/optimizing-large-scale-displays/">optimize our designs for larger screens</a>.</p>
<h2 id="progressive-enhancement-everywhere"><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/enhancement/">Progressive Enhancement Everywhere</a> <a class="direct-link" href="#progressive-enhancement-everywhere">#</a></h2>
<p>The term <em>progressive enhancement</em>, coined around 2003, is not new, but I think its adoption and popularity will only trend upward. Voice-based user interfaces and artificial intelligence  I've become more fully aware of the concept by following the work of Jeremy Keith and Aaron Gustafson. I'm currently reading and enjoying Gustafson's <a href="http://adaptivewebdesign.info/"><em>Adaptive Web Design</em> book</a>, in which he describes interaction design as a series of enhancement layers built on top of a foundation of raw content and information:</p>
<ol>
<li>Markup (HTML, WAI-ARIA) is an enhancement layer, giving semantic structure to the content elements and exposing meaning to assistive technologies;</li>
<li>Visual Design (Images, CSS, animations) is an enhancement layer, guiding the audience with visual prompts, identity, and delight;</li>
<li>Interaction (Javascript) is the final enhancement layer, esablishing a baseline experience and fallbacks for interactions in which none, or only some of the programming is executed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Developing with this approach means that your content, service, and intention reaches the widest possible audience and accepts a broad and ever-increasing spectrum of input types and device capabilities‚Äîan exetension of the diversity of the human population itself and the human experience in the information age.</p>
