<div class="e-content flow">
<p>I vividly remember looking at apartments in Knoxville on January 13, 2010. I only remember that it was the thirteenth, because it was the morning after <a href="https://www.knoxnews.com/story/sports/college/university-of-tennessee/football/2020/01/12/10-years-ago-lane-kiffin-left-tennessee-vols-become-coach-usc/4448431002/">Lane Kiffin announced he was leaving the Tennessee Vols</a>. It was quite the weekend on sports talk radio as I was driving around town.</p>
<p>Thirteen years and four head coaches later, I’m getting ready to call a new city home. Albuquerque is the largest city in the state of New Mexico, and we’re moving to be closer to family. I dig the mountains, and I’ll be closer to hiking trails than I’ve been in a very long time. But I’ll need to save my thoughts for a future post, because this one is about the city of Knoxville.</p>
<h2 id="finding-your-way">Finding your way <a class="direct-link" href="#finding-your-way">#</a></h2>
<p>My first job in Knoxville was for the 2010 U.S. Census. If you’re in a brand new city, the Census is a great way to learn your way around. I later found work with a temp agency and eventually at the University of Tennessee, where I worked as a graphic and web designer.</p>
<p>Knoxville is one of those places many people have head of but never visited, or drived past because of it’s location on I-40 and I-75. Most people know the Tennessee Vols are here, and the Great Smoky Mountains are nearby, along with Dollywood. Maybe they know about Oak Ridge and its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Ridge,_Tennessee#Manhattan_Project">Secret City history</a> with the Manhattan Project. Or they watched the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bart_on_the_Road">infamous <i>Simpsons</i> episode</a> in which the Sunsphere (from the 1982 World’s Fair) is revealed to be full of wigs.</p>
<p>I learned a lot about the city reading Jack Neely’s columns (R.I.P., <i>Metro Pulse</i> and <i>Knoxville Mercury</i>). Neely founded the <a href="https://knoxvillehistoryproject.org/about/">Knoxville History Project</a>, which continues to inform and entertain through its publishing, walking tours, and regular programming. A visit to the <a href="https://www.beckcenter.net/">Beck Cultural Exchange Center</a> on Dandridge Avenue is vital to understanding Knoxville’s history and the contributions of generations of African Americans in East Tennessee.</p>
<h2 id="treasures-and-hidden-gems">Treasures and hidden gems <a class="direct-link" href="#treasures-and-hidden-gems">#</a></h2>
<p>If you’re planning a visit to Knoxville, here’s some things I would suggest.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wdvx.com/program/blue-plate-special/">WDVX Blue Plate Special</a> is a live lunchtime radio show every weekday featuring national touring acts as well as local/regional musicians. The nicest evening concert venues in town are the Tennessee Theatre and the Bijou Theatre, both on Gay Street. While you’re downtown, Market Square is worth checking out, for dining, shopping, farmer’s markets, buskers and the weekend festivals, especially during the spring.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://mcclungmuseum.utk.edu/visit/exhibitions/">McClung Museum of Natural History and Culture</a> is on UT's campus, and features several rotating exhibits. You can Park in Circle Park for 45 minutes if you are visiting the museum. The <a href="https://ewing-gallery.utk.edu/">Ewing Gallery</a> in the Art and Architecture building is a quick walk across the street and usually features great contemporary artists.</p>
<p>In the Bearden neighborhood, you can see <a href="https://knoxvillehistoryproject.org/bearden-historic-points-interest/">Ingrid Bergman's signature and handprints in concrete</a> at the site of the Capri Theatre in Homberg Place.</p>
<p>Knoxville has many beautiful parks, in all parts of the city. <a href="https://www.ijams.org/">Ijams Nature Center</a> is worth a visit, and has a site-specific music installation composed by Ellen Reid and performed by Kronos Quartet. You can access the piece through the <a href="https://www.ellenreidsoundwalk.com/">Soundwalk smartphone app</a>. I love seeing the old marble quarries and walking by the Tennessee River.</p>
<p>The Fourth and Gill neighborhood in North Knoxville has many remarkable Victorian and Queene Anne homes, and can be a nice walk or drive. The nearby commercial district is called Happy Holler and is quite eclectic. North Knoxville’s Fulton High School operates a fantastic oldies radio station (hits from the 50s through the 90s) on 91.1 FM.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.museumofappalachia.org/">The Museum of Appalachia</a> in Clinton features structures, artifacts, and handwritten signs and cards telling the story of each item. My personal favorites are the musical instrument room and the apocalyptic signage.</p>
<h2 id="gone%2C-but-not-forgotten">Gone, but not forgotten <a class="direct-link" href="#gone%2C-but-not-forgotten">#</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://panhandlermagazine.com/art/yee-haw-industries/">Yee-Haw Industrial Letterpress</a> (or sometimes Yee-Haw Industries) was a unique storefront on Gay Street featuring affordable graphic prints, gifts, and tons of letterpress printing equipment. It closed in 2012. Yee-Haw Brewing Company opened in 2015 in Johnson City, but as far as I know has no affiliation or affinity to that beloved print studio.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/13769">The Minister’s Treehouse</a> was near Crossville, about an hour away on your way to Nashville. The pictures on the Roadside America website don't do it justice. The Tennessee Fire Marshall shut it down in 2012, and then it went up in flames in 2019.</p>
<p>King Tut Grill, or <a href="https://www.knoxnews.com/story/shopper-news/south-knox/2022/02/02/king-tut-grill-south-knoxville-closes-after-decades/9226752002/">King Tut's, quietly closed Dec. 31, 2021</a>. Eating there was definitely an <em>experience</em>, and I'll leave it at that.</p>
<h2 id="a-couple-regrets">A couple regrets <a class="direct-link" href="#a-couple-regrets">#</a></h2>
<p>I haven’t finished reading James Agee’s <i>A Death in the Family</i>, or Cormac McCarthy’s <i>Suttree</i>, which are both set in Knoxville and the surrounding area. I never attended the <a href="https://bigearsfestival.org/">Big Ears music festival</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-keeps-knoxville-great">What keeps Knoxville great <a class="direct-link" href="#what-keeps-knoxville-great">#</a></h2>
<p>Yes, I’m going to miss this place, but most of all I’ll miss the people here. I attended the same <a href="https://www.stjamesknox.org/">Episcopal church on North Broadway</a> for all 13 years. I’ve tried to do what I can to make the workplace better and connect with others who are working to make the city and state a better place to live. Lots of friends have come and gone during our time here. I look forward to coming back to visit.</p>
