<h1 class="p-name">Adding an accessibility statement</h1>

<small class="timestamp">Published <time datetime="2022-05-30T11:23:57.000Z" class="dt-published"><a class="u-url" href=".">May 30, 2022</a></time> by <a rel="author" class="p-author h-card" href="/info/">Nick</a></small>

<div class="e-content flow">
<p>With the latest deployment of this website, you should be able to see a link labeled ‚ÄúAccessibility‚Äù in the <code>footer</code>. This will take you to my <a href="/accessibility/">accessibility statement</a>. This is important to me for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I tried to make all the features and content on my site as accessible as I know how to do. I want my users to know I care about them.</li>
<li>I want people who work with me to understand the importance of digital accessibility and my commitment to ongoing learning and social responsibility.</li>
<li>If there are errors or accessibility issues on my site, I need to know about them so I can go about fixing them as quickly as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>It‚Äôs far more common to see accessibility statements where they may be legally required, such as large corporations, governments, and education websites. I have noticed a few people I look up to include statements on their personal sites, and I‚Äôve linked to them on my own page. I hope this is a trend that continues!</p>
<p>When I set out to <a href="/posts/2020-newww-year/">redesign my site in December 2020</a>, providing an accessible experience was top of mind. With every new feature and page I add to my website, I consider accessibility and do my best to address it.</p>
<p>Often times this looks like running a URL through an automated accessibility checker. I personally love browser-based tools, and my longtime favorites are <a href="https://wave.webaim.org">WAVE</a> and <a href="https://tenon.io/">Tenon</a>. These tools are good, and it‚Äôs fun or challenging to get a ‚Äúscore‚Äù. But they‚Äôre only capable of catching <a href="https://marcysutton.com/evinced-automated-accessibility-testing">30-50% of accessibility issues on a page</a>, so it‚Äôs important to do some manual checks.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://github.com/nsmsn/nicksimsondotcom/commit/929d7530e076763228f86a0775178f3b530688bb">fixed an issue</a> recently on my <a href="/library/">Library page</a>, when I discovered redundant alt text on linked images. In this case, I had both a book cover image and book title linked and going to the same destination, and I was using the book title as the image‚Äôs <code>alt</code> attribute. I was trained to always use alt text on a linked image, but in this case if there is text in the link describing the link destination, it is OK to use an empty <code>alt=&quot;&quot;</code>. <a href="https://blog.pope.tech/2020/03/13/linked-image-missing-alternative-text-example/">Pope Tech has a great blog post on this</a>, using an image card component as an example.</p>
<p>An accessibility statement is not going to prevent me from running into issues like this, but it does communicate my dedication to fixing these things as I discover them. I also included two ways my audience can report accessibility issues or barriers to me. Finally, I thought it was important to state that I am always learning new things about digital accessibility and will share what I learn.</p>
