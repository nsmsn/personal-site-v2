## Profile

I am a public sector communication designer with over a decade of professional experience. Most of my day is spent designing, building and maintaining websites at the University of Tennessee. I'm working on getting better at content strategy and digital accessibility.

I also occasionally contribute pixels, code, and CMS know-how for small projects, independent artists and other worthy causes. I’m married to [Eleanor](https://eleanoraldrich.com), who makes paintings. We live in Knoxville with Zelda, our dog.

### About this Website
This is my personal website and blog. Like most websites, this one is perpetually under development. You can track its progress at [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/nsmsn/nicksimsondotcom). This is built and deployed with [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev/) and Netlify, and I am prioritizing performance and accessibility. For those interested in digging deeper, I'm [writing a series of posts](/tags/redesign/) as I fine tune the design and tech behind the site.
