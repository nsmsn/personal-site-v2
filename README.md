# Being the personal website of one Nick Simson

In late 2020/early 2021 I rebuilt and relaunched my long-dormant blog with [Eleventy](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy), a static site generator. 


## Starter Files
I used the popular [eleventy-base-blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) as a starting point, and ported my previous content over, starting with my posts. Along the way I added Node-Sass support which I forked into a new [eleventy-base-blog-sass](https://github.com/nsmsn/eleventy-base-blog-sass) project.

## Syndication
My posts are available in a [RSS feed](https://www.nicksimson.com/feed/feed.xml) and a [JSON feed](https://www.nicksimson.com/feed/feed.json)

## IndieWeb Support
This site uses h-card and h-entry [microformats](https://microformats.org/wiki/Main_Page) and is a part of [an IndieWeb Webring](https://xn--sr8hvo.ws/).
