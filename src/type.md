If you are using a modern web browser supporting [WOFF2](https://caniuse.com/woff2) and [variable fonts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Fonts/Variable_Fonts_Guide), this website will render text in the following typefaces. Older, unsupported browsers will still render text in a carefully selected system font fallback.

The primary typeface used on this site is <b>[Literata](https://www.type-together.com/literata-font)</b>, a serif variable font designed by Veronika Burian and Jos√© Scaglione through their foundry, TypeTogether. Originally designed as the custom typeface for all Google Play Books, Literata was conceived for intensive editorial use, especially on screens of all sorts.
