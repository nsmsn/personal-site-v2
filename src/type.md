The primary typeface used on this site is <b>[Literata](https://www.type-together.com/literata-font)</b>, a serif variable font designed by Veronika Burian and Jos√© Scaglione through their foundry, TypeTogether. Originally designed as the custom typeface for all Google Play Books, Literata was conceived for intensive editorial use, especially on screens of all sorts.
