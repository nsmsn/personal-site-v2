## Profile

I am a public sector communication designer with over a decade of professional experience. I spend most of my day designing, building, and maintaining websites at a large public university.

I also occasionally contribute pixels, code, and CMS know-how for small projects, independent artists and other worthy causes. I’m married to [Eleanor](https://eleanoraldrich.com), who makes paintings. We live in Knoxville with Zelda, our dog.

See what I’m up to [now](/now/).

## About this Website

This is my personal website and blog. Like most websites, this one is perpetually under development. You can track its progress at [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/nsmsn/nicksimsondotcom). I build and deploy this with [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev/) and [Netlify](https://netlify.com), and I am prioritizing performance and accessibility.

You can read [a note on the type](/type) to learn about the fonts in use. For those interested in digging deeper, I’m [writing a series of posts](/tags/redesign/) as I fine tune the design and tech behind the site.
