## Profile

I’m a designer with over a decade of professional experience. I’ve spent most of that time working at higher education institutions. Today I’m a user interface (UI) designer at a nonprofit member association in Washington,&nbsp;DC.

I’ve been lucky to work with some wonderful artists, musicians, scientists, and writers on design projects, especially interactive stuff. I spent a long time as a generalist and thrive on learning new&nbsp;things.

See what I’m up to [now](/now/).

I’m married to [Eleanor](https://eleanoraldrich.com), who makes paintings. We live in New Mexico with our toddler and a small&nbsp;[dog](https://dogsof.dev/dogs/zelda/).

## About this website

This is my personal website. I registered the domain name in 2008 and renew it at the end of each year as a small gift to myself. I tinker with this site’s writing, design, and code as I learn new things and feel motivated, mainly during evenings and weekends.
