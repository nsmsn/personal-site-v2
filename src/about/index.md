## Profile

I am a public sector communication designer with over a decade of professional experience. I spend most of my day designing, building, and maintaining websites at a large public university.

I also occasionally contribute my graphic design and web development skills for small projects, independent artists and other worthy causes. I’m married to [Eleanor](https://eleanoraldrich.com), who makes paintings. We live in Knoxville with our daughter and a small [dog](https://dogsof.dev/dogs/zelda/).

See what I’m up to [now](/now/).
