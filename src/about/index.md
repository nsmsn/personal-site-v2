## Profile

I am a public sector communication designer with over a decade of professional experience. I spend most of my day designing, building, and maintaining websites at a large public university.

I also occasionally contribute pixels, code, and CMS know-how for small projects, independent artists and other worthy causes. I’m married to [Eleanor](https://eleanoraldrich.com), who makes paintings. We live in Knoxville with Zelda, our dog.

See what I’m up to [now](/now/).

## About this website

This is my personal website and blog. At some point I decided that a respectable web designer needs their own place to experiment and try things out. I tinker with this site’s writing, design, and code as I feel motivated, mainly during evenings and weekends.

You can track this site’s progress and iterations at [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/nsmsn/nicksimsondotcom). This site is built and deployed with [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev/) and [Netlify](https://netlify.com). My blog posts are available in both [RSS](https://www.nicksimson.com/feed/feed.xml) and [JSON](https://www.nicksimson.com/feed/feed.json). I prioritize performance and accessibility. You can read [a note on the type](/type) to learn about the fonts in use.
