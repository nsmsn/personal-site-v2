## Profile

I’m a graphic / communication / interaction designer with over a decade of professional experience. I spent a long time as a generalist and thrive on learning new things. I’m married to [Eleanor](https://eleanoraldrich.com), who makes paintings. We live in Knoxville with our daughter and a small&nbsp;[dog](https://dogsof.dev/dogs/zelda/).

See what I’m up to [now](/now/).
