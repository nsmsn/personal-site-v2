I’m back at work from parental leave and reconciling my old routine and responsibilities with my new ones. Our baby seems to be doing pretty well so far.

## Learning

I am continuing to work on my proficiencies by [exploring each core web technology](/tags/learning) (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) with more breadth and depth.

I am also working toward [certification as an accessibility professional](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/certification).

## Reading

I set up a <a href="https://log.nicksimson.com/nightstand/">nightstand</a> over on my [microblog](https://log.nicksimson.com/), which is updated automatically as I use Micro.blog to track my reading habits.

Current titles (as of this update) include <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/763157781"><i>Bird on Fire: Lessons from the World’s Least Sustainable City</i></a> by Andrew Ross and <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1309129003"><i>Worn: a People's History of Clothing</i></a> by Sofi Thanhauser.

## Knoxville

The Scruffy Little City continues to be home base. Spring and fall are the best seasons in East Tennessee. You should visit.
