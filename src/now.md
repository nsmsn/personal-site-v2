Happy holidays! <span class="home-heading">☃️</span>


## 👶 Parenting
Our little one is around 9 months old and is [self-propelled](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/Crawling-Styles.aspx) now. We’ve been introducing her to a variety of foods. We try to be faithful to a routine, but allow for novelty as much as we can. Each day brings new joys and new challenges.

## 💼 Career update
In late October I started a new role as **lead user interface designer** at a DC-based nonprofit. I’m excited for this new challenge, and to be specializing in UI work. I’m working with a wonderful digital experience team, and I am enjoying being a work-at-home dad.

## 📍 Knoxville
The Scruffy Little City continues to be home base. Spring and fall are the best seasons here in East Tennessee. You should plan a visit.
