Iâ€™m back at work from parental leave and reconciling my old routine and responsibilities with my new ones. Our baby seems to be doing pretty well so far.

## Learning

I am continuing to work on my proficiencies by [exploring each core web technology](/tags/learning) (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) with more breadth and depth.

I am also working toward [certification as an accessibility professional](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/certification).

## Reading

There are no reading goals for 2022 except to read a little each day. I am using both [Literal](https://literal.club/nsmsn/is-reading) and <a href="https://log.nicksimson.com/categories/books/">Micro.blog</a> to track my reading.

## Knoxville

The Scruffy Little City continues to be home base. Spring and fall are the best seasons in East Tennessee. You should visit.
