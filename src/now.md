My wife and I welcomed the arrival of our [first child](/posts/2022-lullabies/) in March. I’ve been back at work from parental leave and I am reconciling my old routine and responsibilities with my new ones. We’ll be spending this summer introducing our little one to her grandparents, aunts, uncle and cousins. She seems to be doing pretty well so far.

## Learning

I am continuing to work on my proficiencies by [exploring each core web technology](/tags/learning) (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) with more breadth and depth.

I am also working toward [certification as an accessibility professional](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/certification).

## Reading

There are no reading goals for 2022 except to read a little each day. I am using both [Literal](https://literal.club/nsmsn/is-reading) and <a href="https://log.nicksimson.com/categories/books/">Micro.blog</a> to track my reading.

## Knoxville

The Scruffy Little City continues to be home base. Spring and fall are the best seasons in East Tennessee. You should visit.
