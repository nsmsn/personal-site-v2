Here’s to a happy and healthy 2023! 🐇


## 👶 Parenting
Our little one is quickly approaching her first birthday, and her personality is emerging in surprising ways. Not quite ready to take her first steps, but enjoying her newfound mobility.

## 💼 Career update
Back in October I started a new role as **lead user interface designer** at the [Association of American Medical Colleges](https://www.aamc.org/) (AAMC). I’m excited to join this organization at this time, and to be digging deeper into UI work. I’ve been working with a wonderful digital experience team, and I am enjoying being a work-at-home dad.

## 🤓 Learning
Here’s some of the design and tech topics/projects I’m currently interested in:

* [Progressive Web Apps](https://web.dev/learn/pwa/) (PWA)

## 📍 Knoxville
The Scruffy Little City continues to be home base. Spring and fall are the best seasons here in East Tennessee. You should plan a visit.
