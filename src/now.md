## 👶 Parenting

Already five months old now, our little one has met her grandparents, aunts, uncle and cousins. We’ve taken her on her [first hike](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/tennessee/emory-gap-trail) and she really seems to enjoy being outside. As she gets ready to sit, crawl, and explore, we are getting more adventurous as well, planning our first overnight trips as a family of three.

## 🤓 Learning

I’m continuing to work on my proficiencies by [exploring each core web technology](/tags/learning) (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) with more breadth and depth.

I’m also working toward [certification as an accessibility professional](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/certification).

Other design and tech topics/projects I am currently interested in:

* [Progressive Web Apps](https://web.dev/learn/pwa/) (PWA)

## 📚 Reading

I’m trying to read a little each day in 2022. I am currently using both [Literal](https://literal.club/nsmsn/is-reading) and <a href="https://log.nicksimson.com/categories/books/">Micro.blog</a> to track my reading.

## 📍 Knoxville

The Scruffy Little City continues to be home base. Spring and fall are the best seasons here in East Tennessee. You should plan a visit.
