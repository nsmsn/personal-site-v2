## Learning

This year, I am honing my web skills by revisiting each core web technology (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). My goal is to get up to speed on the modern stuff, and re-learn the medium with more breadth and depth. I am also exploring [certification as an accessibility professional](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/certification).
