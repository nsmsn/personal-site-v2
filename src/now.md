## Learning

This year, I am honing my web skills by revisiting each core web technology (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and re-learning this medium with more breadth and depth. I am also exploring [certification as an accessibility professional](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/certification).

## Reading

The days are getting longer, and so are the books. Here are my current titles:

- <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1137087735"><i>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</i></a> by Haruki&nbsp;Murakami ðŸŽ§

- <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/mason-and-dixon/oclc/243705730"><i>Mason and Dixon</i></a> by Thomas&nbsp;Pynchon ðŸ“±

- <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/regeneration-through-violence-the-mythology-of-the-american-frontier-1600-1860/oclc/333612"><i>Regeneration Through Violence: The Mythology of the American frontier, 1600-1860</i></a> by Richard Slotkin ðŸ“–

## Volunteering

Iâ€™m serving my final year as a vestry member at [St. Jamesâ€™ Episcopal Church](http://stjamesknox.org) in 2021.

Weâ€™re continuing to build <strong>people power</strong> with [Justice Knox](http://justiceknox.org) in this organizationâ€™s fifth year. Iâ€™m getting involved with affordable housing research and leading a network team again.

## Knoxville

The Scruffy Little City continues to be home base. Now that itâ€™s getting warmer, Iâ€™ve been enjoying all the great parks in town and nearby, allergies be damned.
