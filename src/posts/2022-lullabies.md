I’m a dad! [Eleanor](https://eleanoraldrich.com) and I welcomed the arrival of our first child. Witnessing her birth was the most amazing experience and we’re thankful for a safe delivery and healthy baby.

I’m taking several weeks off work (thankfully I am among the 26 percent of public sector workers in the U.S. with paid family leave) to get to know this tiny person. There’s so much to soak in right now and so much more to look forward to.
