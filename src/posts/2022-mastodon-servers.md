<div class="panel">
Edited on <time datetime="2022-12-06">Dec. 6, 2022</time>: I recently moved to a smaller instance. <a href="https://mastodon.design">Mastodon.design</a> is a well-moderated instance of a few hundred people, and may be more “on brand” for me.

I created an account on Mastodon back in April 2017, mainly to claim my dumb five-character username. Now that many of the people (web developers, artists, academics, media people) I once followed on Twitter are migrating to the open-source, federated social network, I may find myself using this account more. *Update: You can now find me at [@nsmsn@mastodon.design](https://mastodon.design/@nsmsn)*

I still plan to use my [Micro.blog](http://micro.blog/nsmsn) for most of my microblogging, and will try to keep my [/following page](/following/) on this website up to date. Generally, I’m interested in working on connecting the microblog to my main website and [syndicating](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) content to my other social channels. The websites of [Jeremy Keith](https://adactio.com/) and [Paul Robert Lloyd](https://paulrobertlloyd.com/notes/) are two of the best examples I’ve encountered.

## Finding people and their servers on Mastodon
[Amelia Wattenberger](https://wattenberger.com/) made a [handy web app](https://mastodon-bridge.vercel.app/) for finding people from Twitter with Mastodon accounts. The app organizes the people you follow based on the Mastodon instance their account is on. Earlier this week, I used this app to find and re-follow several people who’ve retired their Twitter accounts and moved to Mastodon in a large exodus. 

This is not an exhaustive list of Mastodon servers, just a list (in late November 2022) where some the people I follow landed in the “fediverse”.
