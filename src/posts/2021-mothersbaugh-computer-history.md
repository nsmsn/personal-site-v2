Once you stumble upon it on YouTube, the Computer History Museum's [Oral History series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQsxaNhYv8daKdGi7s85ubzbWdTB36-_q) is a wonderful trove of technologists, pioneers, and inventors sharing their histories in their own words. Composer and DEVO frontman Mark Mothersbaugh [sat down with CHM](https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2018/02/102738588-05-01-acc.pdf) a few years ago to talk about his synthesizers, his process, and his beginnings in Akron, Ohio.

The [video below](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfeLBV3J6NI) was recorded in 2017:

Mothersbaugh’s [studio in Los Angeles](http://mutato.com/) is famous for its collection of synths, [circuit-bended](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_bending) instruments, and sound technology going back decades, including [Raymond Scott’s Electronium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronium). A highlight of this interview is hearing him compare his relationship to the Mini Moog to that of a soldier and his rifle.

My favorite part of this video is toward the end (around the <a href="https://youtu.be/YfeLBV3J6NI?t=4098">01:08:18</a> mark), when Mothersbaugh pulls out a postage stamp collector’s binder filled with drawings on paper:

<blockquote>
Everyday, I draw on paper... I draw on paper everyday, since 19...early 70s. I was into mail art, is how it started. And I found that a nobody from Akron, Ohio, that nobody’d ever heard of, called Mark Mothersbaugh, could take a piece of paper and send it to Robert Indiana, or send it to Jasper Johns,or Irene Dogmatic, or Mr. Peanut, and there was a good chance they would send something back to me. And it was like, to get something in the mail from Robert Indiana was such a... it was amazing. I felt like I was on the map...So I was doing these drawings all the time and sending them out, and then I was also putting together a band. And in the process of that, I was sending something out to somebody, and I said, “Hey, these... this could be&ndash;if we ever get to do a record, this could be the cover for it.” And I started to put it in the mail, and then I said, “Wait a second. Maybe I should be saving this stuff.”
</blockquote>

I especially love the consistency of these sketchbooks: choosing the same size paper to draw on each day and cataloguing them all in hundreds of stamp binders. You can see some of [Mothersbaugh’s visual art on his website](https://markmothersbaughart.com/art/).

We [nearly lost Mark Mothersbaugh last year to COVID-19](https://pitchfork.com/news/devos-mark-mothersbaugh-opens-up-about-covid-19-hospitalization-and-recovery/). Thankfully he’ll still be producing art and music for years to come, adding to his impressive archive.

<strong>Bonus video:</strong> A friend with two young kids reminded me that Mark Mothersbaugh was a regular on the children’s TV show <i>Yo Gabba Gabba</i>, contributing segments where he would make a drawing and interact with the animated sketch:
