There's a dearth of fiction on this 2020 list, and I'm going to try to correct that in 2021. I have a Pynchon novel on the nightstand as well as a Murakami audiobook on my phone.

As always, this is not a list of endorsements&mdash;just an honest list of books I consumed. I will use a ⭐ star emoji to denote books I thoroughly enjoyed or would recommend. I'll also use emoji to denote whether I consumed each item on this list as a 📖 paper book, 📱ebook,  or listened as 🎧 audio.
