In 2019 I consumed a lot of books that I would consider "impulse adds" on Goodreads. A bunch were from authors I heard on radio or podcasts. I know I attempted a novel, a collection of short stories and maybe other works of fiction this year, but clearly they did not stick.

As always, this is not a list of endorsements&mdash;just an honest list of books I consumed. I will use a ⭐ star emoji to denote books I thoroughly enjoyed or would recommend. I'll also use emoji to denote whether I consumed each item on this list as a 📖 paper book, 📱ebook,  or listened as 🎧 audio.
