In 2015 I became a dog guardian for the first time. Zelda is still a young pup and requires a lot of walking, so audiobooks are becoming my new friend. I expect I will be listening to a lot more in 2017.

I should also mention that these are not all endorsements, just books I finished. The ones I really liked and would recommend will be marked with a ⭐ star emoji.

In addition of keeping track of what I read, I'll also use emoji to denote whether I read this as a 📖 paper book, 📱ebook/PDF,  or listened as 🎧 audio.
