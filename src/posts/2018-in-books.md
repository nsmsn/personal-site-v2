In 2018 we bought our first home, a hundred year old house in North Knoxville. I think I listened to more audiobooks in this year becuase of the painting and other jobs that had to be done during my free time...in addition to the walks with the dog.

As always, this is not a list of endorsements&mdash;just an honest list of books I consumed. I will use a ⭐ star emoji to denote books I thoroughly enjoyed or would recommend. I'll also use emoji to denote whether I consumed each item on this list as a 📖 paper book, 📱ebook,  or listened as 🎧 audio.
