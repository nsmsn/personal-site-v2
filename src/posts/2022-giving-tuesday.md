Today is [Giving Tuesday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GivingTuesday), a worldwide holiday for giving to organizations working to transform their communities. Since 2012, it has been celebrated the Tuesday after Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Cyber Monday to highlight charity, philanthropy and nonprofits doing good around the globe. The official [GivingTuesday.org website](https://www.givingtuesday.org/) uses the phrase “radical generosity” throughout its content, defined as “the concept that the suffering of others should be as intolerable to us as our own suffering.”

On the tenth anniversary of Giving Tuesday, I want to highlight a few *radical* organizations I try to support throughout the year. Most of these may be flying under the radar of Bill and Melinda Gates, PayPal, the Ford Foundation, and the other large philanthropic partners behind Giving Tuesday, the 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.

All these organizations are based in the U.S., where I live, and several touch the lives of people in places that have been important to me. I hope this post inspires you to find the people who are organizing for the greater good in your community and fund them. Be generous, radically, throughout the year.

## Florence Immigrant &amp; Refugee Rights Project
<span class="text-meta">Arizona</span>
“The Florence Project is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit legal service organization providing free legal and social services to adults and unaccompanied children in immigration custody in Arizona. Although the government assists indigent criminal defendants and civil litigants through public defenders and legal aid attorneys, it does not provide attorneys for people in immigration removal proceedings. As a result, an estimated 86 percent of the detained people go unrepresented due to poverty. The Florence Project strives to address this inequity both locally and nationally through direct service, partnerships with the community, and advocacy and outreach efforts.”
