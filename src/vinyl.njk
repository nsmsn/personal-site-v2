<h1>Vinyl</h1>

<p>A collection of music I’ve accumulated over the years. I only buy records I intend to listen to, so everything here has been played again and&nbsp;again.</p> 

<p>Releases are organized alphabetically by artist, and chronologically by release date. It will be some time before the collection is fully cataloged, so this page is very much a work in&nbsp;progress.</p>


<ul class="list-unstyled auto-grid">
  {% for item in vinyl.items %}
  <li>
  <div class="lib-item">
            <a class="lib-title" href="{{ item.url }}">
            <img class="lib-cover" src="/img/vinyl/{{ item.cover }}" alt="" width="200" loading="lazy" />
            <span>{{ item.title }}</span></a>
            <p>{{ item.artist }}<br/>
            <span class="lib-item-year">{{ item.year }}</span></p>
    </div>
  </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
