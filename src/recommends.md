After doing graphic design and web stuff for 10+ years now, I often get questions about domain registration, hosting, and printing.

These are not the only services I use or have used, but ones I have found to be very user-friendly and feel comfortable recommending to others. I am not being paid to post these links on my website, but making a purchase will give me a little kickback. Most of these referrals will credit my existing account on each site.
